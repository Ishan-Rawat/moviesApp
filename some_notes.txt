These notes start from the 5th section of the tutorial: https://youtu.be/nu_pCVPKzTk

We will be creating a backend API that will be used to work with movie reviews
An API is a way for 2 or more programs to communicate with each other. 
In our case we'll use it to send URL endpoints or inpoints(not clear) to interact with the database.

Our API will create, read, update, and delete movie reviews.

STEP 1: We are going to use ES6 import statements in our project and they are not supported by default in Node.js so we have to modify the package.json file.
right after main, we are going to add type : 'module', .

Now we can start working on the backend server. (Whoa, are we creating a backend server, an API, or both, or do they mean the same thing or what??)
We are going to seperate the code of our server from the code that accesses the database.

First up we are going to import express and cors.
Express: Its a web framework for node.js which we'll use to make HTTP endpoints that will be used by the web server.
CORS: Stands for Cross Origin Resource Sharing. It allows AJAX to skip the same origin policy and access resources from remote hosts. It will basically allow us to prevent some errors from happening when we try to access our database from a different host as our server.
